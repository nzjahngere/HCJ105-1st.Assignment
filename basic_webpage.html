        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry - (Source: Wikipeia).</p>

        <h3>Markup</h3>
        <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like 'h1' and '/h1', although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example 'img'. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
        <br />
        <h4>Elements</h4>
        <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: p.</p>

        <h5>Transition of HTML publication to WHATWG</h5>
        <p>On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards. The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions.The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the de facto web standard for some time.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>Data Types in HTML</h6>
        <p>HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of character data.</p>
